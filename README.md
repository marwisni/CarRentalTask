## Introduction - the project's aim 🎯

This is Python 3 project to generate dummy data for fictive car rental. 

## Technologies and tools 👨‍💻

In our project we are using following technologies and tools:

### Technologies

- Python programming language in version 3.9.

### Databases

- MariaDB
### Tools

- Git

## Release Versions 🔨

Currently working on version where if service is needed for particular car then it happens immediately after car is returned to the rental (in the "same_day"). It is impossible to rent this car again before necessary services.
This solution is being developed on the "same_day" branch. It is planned to develop also version where it is possible to rent car immediately after previous rental without necessary service. In this scenario service will happen "next_day" after car will be returned to the rental if there will be one day break between rentals. This solution will be developed on "next_day" branch. 

## Launch 🚀

Simply run main.py file from main branch.
